  \begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}
  \small
  10 yrs experience building cloud-native applications,
  from database design and server management up through
  front-end development.  Most recently worked on the
  backend of a high-throughput intelligent DNS service,
  managing a highly-distributed fleet of  global DNS
  servers. Always excited to learn new languages and
  technologies, and relish in understanding the ins and
  outs of large systems.  Convinced that good data
  collection, analysis, and visualization is crucial for
  understanding any complex application.  Constantly
  reminded that software is built by people, and thus
  advocate for and facilitate healthy communication
  between and within teams.
