\begin{res_section}{Summary}
  \noindent
  \begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}
  \small
  10 yrs experience building cloud-native applications, from database design and server management up through front-end development.
  Most recently worked on the backend of a high-throughput intelligent DNS service, managing a highly-distributed fleet of
  global DNS servers. Always excited to learn new languages and technologies, and relish in understanding the ins and outs of large systems.
  Convinced that good data collection, analysis, and visualization is crucial for understanding any complex application.
  Constantly reminded that software is built by people, and thus advocate for and facilitate healthy communication between and within teams.
