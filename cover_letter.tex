To the hiring manager,

I want to share a bit about why I'm particularly excited about the position for a Software
Engineer on the Language \& Translation team at Wikimedia. Firstly, of course, I've long relied on
various Wikimedia projects to sate my endless curiosity about the world and contributed back
from time to time, and I would be thrilled to to be part of the team that ensures those resources
are available to a wider global audience.

Additionally, my career thus far has prepared me well for this position. To briefly call out a few items
from my experience that are relevant:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Created and maintained the full breadth of a LAMP-stack application as founding engineer of SERPs.com,
       including frontend Javascript frameworks for the user interface
 \item Engaged in intentional engineering as part of a small team at Citrix, including code reviews, unit tests,
       and architectural planning
 \item Strong communicator, often acted as contact point between my team and others
 \item Worked remotely with technical staff in offices around the world, including Paris and Singapore
 \item Modernized and refactored code piecewise while maintaining momentum and ensuring test coverage
 \item Described relevant parts of our system to outside interests, including security reviews and other
       teams that are building integration points
 \item Worked with various open source projects over the years, submitting patches and pull requests
 \item Maintained a basic working knowledge of Spanish that I would enjoy getting to expand on
\end{itemize}

I believe that open knowledge and open software are crucial to making the internet accessible to all, alongside
robust internationalization. Information is only truly free if everyone can access it in their own language,
and the internet is an incredible opportunity to realize that goal. Using my time and skills to help Wikimedia
further those efforts is an exciting opportunity.

I believe I'm well equipped for this position, and it involves a lot of the things I am passionate about:
free and open knowledge, accessibility of information in all languages, and working for the sake of the public
good. I look forward to hearing more about how I can contribute to making Wikimedia a stronger, more
inclusive organization.

Sincerely,
