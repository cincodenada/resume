Hello,

I am excited to see the role on the Archiving & Data Services team at the Internet Archive as my
skills, goals, and personal interests are an excellent match with the position. Especially at this
point in my career, I am looking for roles I can invest in personally as well as professionally.
I’ve followed IA and admired its work for well over a decade. I believe archival work like this is
truly crucial to the health of the Internet and society at large. IA’s mission in doing that work
aligns strongly with my own values.

I've worked with many technologies throughout my career and endeavor to develop expertise in
whatever tools my team happens to be using. I have often become the "point person" for my teams in
untangling thorny architecture or troubleshooting problems, regardless of whether I knew that
particular tech prior to joining the team. I have assisted with high-pressure operational issues in
complex systems, using ad-hoc data gathering and analysis to identify bottlenecks and eliminate red
herrings, quickly focusing on the actual issues at hand.

On the human side of things, I am particularly passionate about communicating technical concepts and
constraints to diverse stakeholders and collaborating on requirements in a way that avoids costly
miscommunications. I am committed to continued growth, both for myself and my teammates,
 and believe mentorship is a crucial piece of a healthy engineering organization. I value opportunities to learn from others and to share my own knowledge.

My most relevant experience is my time at Cedexis, which also happens to be my favorite professional
experience thus far. We used many technologies to store and quickly access our petabyte-scale
measurement data, including Postgres, BigQuery, and Clickhouse, which backed a sophisticated
in-memory data structure for the time-critical calculations at the edge. This edge was Linux systems
on our own machines that we colocated in POPs across the globe, and I am comfortable administering
such systems.

Understanding the protocols that comprise the web is also a personal passion of mine. Early in my
career I hand-built a basic TCP stack for a personal microcontroller project, and have been pulling
protocols apart ever since. At Cedexis, I personally wrote the DNSSEC implementation for our custom
DNS server, which involved much poring through RFCs and deepening my knowledge of those fundamental
protocols, both as designed and as implemented.

%I enjoy working within a team to accomplish our shared goals, and work
%best when I have some autonomy that allows me to take initiative and bring
%issues or projects I find back to the team as they come up. My work at Cedexis
%was primarily in C++ but involved some Python as well, and I have also worked
%extensively with Python webservices on various projects both on and off the
%clock.

I would be thrilled to get to deepen my experience in all these things while helping keep the
Internet Archive up and running smoothly. The challenge of storing and cataloging the truly
staggering amounts of data that is under the stewardship of the Archive would be a career highlight.
I look forward to talking further about how I can contribute to the team.
  
Sincerely,
