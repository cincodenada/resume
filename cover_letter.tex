Hello,

I am excited to see a position at the Internet Archive come up that matches my skills and goals. At this point
in my career I am looking for positions I can invest in personally, and I've followed IA and its work for well
over a decade. I believe archival work like this is truly crucial to the health of the Internet and society
at large, and IA's mission in doing that work aligns strongly with my own values.

I've worked with many technologies throughout my career, and endeavor to develop expertise in whatever technology
my team happens to be using. I have often become the "point person" for my teams in untangling particularly 
thorny architecture or troubleshooting problems, regardless of whether I knew that particular tech prior to
joining the team. I have assisted with high-pressure operational issues in complex systems, using ad-hoc data
gathering and analysis to quickly diagnose active problems, identifying bottlenecks and eliminating red herrings
to focus on the actual issues at hand. On the human side of things, I am particularly passionate about communicating
technical concepts and constraints to diverse stakeholders and collaborating on requirements in a way that avoids
costly miscommunications, and am committed to continued growth, both for myself and my teammates. Mentorship is
a crucial piece of a healthy organization, and I want to invest in that from both directions.

My most relevant experience is likely my time at Cedexis, which was also my favorite team I've been on. My team built and 
maintained the core backend infrastructure of a highly-distributed system of
100+ DNS servers that took 9 billion daily measurements to make 3 billion
real-time decisions. We used many technologies to store and quickly access our
petabyte-scale measurement data, including Postgres, BigQuery, and Clickhouse, which
backed a sophisticated in-memory data structure for the time-critical
calculations at the edge. This involved a fair amount of Linux system
administration on our own metal machines that we colocated in POPs across the
globe. I also personally wrote the DNSSEC implementation for our custom DNS server,
which involved much poring through RFCs and building a deep understanding of the protocols underlying
the web itself. Understanding this level of the web is also a passion of mine. I hand-built a basic TCP stack for
a microcontroller project in college, and have been pulling protocols apart ever since, more in Wireshark these days than on the logic analzyer, but I am handy at both. 

I enjoy working within a team to accomplish our shared goals, and work
best when I have some autonomy that allows me to take initiative and bring
issues or projects I find back to the team as they come up. My work at Cedexis
was primarily in C++ but involved some Python as well, and I have also worked
extensively with Python webservices on various projects both on and off the
clock. I would be thrilled to get to deepen my experience in complex stateful systems
while helping keep the Internet Archive up and running smoothly. The challenge of storing and catalogging
the truly staggering amounts of data that is under the stewardship of the Archive would be a career highlight,
and I look forward to talking further about how I might fit into the team.

Sincerely,
