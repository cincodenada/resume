\noindent
To the hiring manager,

I'm writing in reference to the opening listed for Backend Engineer 2 at Simple. I've been a Simple customer for years,
and would be happy to join the team and start helping folks feel more in control of their finances.

My career has been building web services, most recently on the backend of a high-throughput service-oriented system
that responds to billions of daily requests using data gathered from billions of daily measurements. 
I consider tests an essential part of any development project, and worked to move to a testing framework that
better met our needs at Citrix. I have a thorough understanding of databases and the ins and outs of APIs, and while I have had limited
professional experience in JVM-based languages, I am always up for learning new technologies and I've been interested
in exploring Scala for a while. I learned C++ for my last position, and I'm confident I could quickly get up to speed with Simple's
stack as well.

Simple is a company that shares many of the values I look for in a company, and I think it would be a great
opportunity for me to expand my horizons and contribute to a meaningful product. I look forward to learning
more about how I could help contribute to the team.

Sincerely,
