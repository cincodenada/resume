To the hiring manager,

I want to share a bit about why I'm particularly excited about the position for a Software
Engineer on the Language \& Translation team at Wikimedia. Firstly, of course, I've long relied on
various Wikimedia projects to sate my endless curiosity about the world and contributed back
from time to time, and I would be thrilled to to be part of the team that ensures those resources
are available to a wider global audience.

My career thus far has prepared me well for this position. To briefly call out a few items
from my experience that are relevant:
\begin{itemize}[nosep,topsep=-0.5em]
 \item Created and maintained frontend, backend, and administration of a LAMP-stack application as founding engineer of SERPs.com
 \item Engaged in intentional engineering as part of a small team at Citrix, including code reviews, unit tests,
       and architectural planning
 \item Strong communicator, acted as liaison between my team and others
 \item Worked remotely with global staff, including Paris and Singapore
 \item Modernized and refactored code piecewise while maintaining momentum and ensuring test coverage
 \item Described relevant parts of systems to outside interests, including security reviews and other
       teams building integration points
 \item Submitted patches and pull requests to open source projects
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.5em}

I believe that open knowledge and open software, together with robust internationalization, are crucial
to making the internet accessible to all. Information is only truly free if everyone can access it in their own language,
and the internet is an incredible opportunity to realize that goal. Using my time and skills to help Wikimedia
further those efforts is an exciting opportunity.

I seem to be well equipped for this position, and it involves much of what I am passionate about, including
free and open knowledge, equal accessibility of information, and working for the sake of the public
good. I look forward to hearing more about how I can contribute to making Wikimedia a stronger, more
inclusive organization.

Sincerely,
