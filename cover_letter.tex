\noindent
To the hiring manager,

I'm excited about the Software Engineer position on the Language \& Translation team at
Wikimedia, firstly of course because I've long relied on various Wikimedia projects to sate my endless curiosity
about the world. This position is an opportunity to contribute in a unique way to the crucial projects
the foundation oversees, and I would be thrilled to be part of the team that
ensures those projects are available to a wider global audience.

It's also an exciting opportunity because it fits my skillset well.
I've built a successful LAMP stack application from the ground up, modernized code
by building out testing, worked closely with my teammates on code reviews and architecture,
communicated effectively with colleagues around the globe. Moreso, this position would also allow me to invest
in areas that I'm passionate about but haven't gotten to engage in professionally. I've often
said that there's an alternate universe in which I was a linguistics major, I have talked many friends'
ears off about the importance of Unicode for global equality, and I find the unique challenges
of translation and internationalization fascinating.

I believe that open knowledge and open software are crucial to making the internet accessible
to all, and in today's world that access to the internet is fundamental to addressing global inequality.
Education is a crucial tool for empowering underprivileged groups, and Wikimedia's many projects
address that need head-on. This team's work in particular is so important because information can only
truly belong to everyone if everyone can access it in their own language. Helping to further that
work is one of the best possible uses of my time and skills.

This position is well-suited to my experience, and involves much of what I am passionate about, including
free and open knowledge, equal accessibility of information, and working for the sake of the public
good. I look forward to talking with you about how I can contribute to making Wikimedia a stronger, more
inclusive organization.

Sincerely,
